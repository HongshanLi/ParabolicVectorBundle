In this note, I want to investigate how to construct a Higgs bundle on $X$ from a variation of 
Hodge structure on $X-D$. 

\section{Extending Hodge filtration}
Let $(V_U, F)$ be a VHS with integral lattice and quasi-unipotent monodromy on $X-D$.
Let $V$ be the Deligne canonical extension of $V_U$, how should one extend the Hodge 
filtration $F$ to $V$, such that the associate graded becomes a Higgs sheaves. 


\section{Parabolic sturctures on VHS and the associated Higgs sheaf}
What are some meaningful geometric interpretation of parabolic structure on VHS and the 
associated Higgs sheaf?

What are the relation between the two parabolic structure?

\section{Vanishing Thm}
To prove the vanishing theorem for the Higgs bundle $E$, it seems that we need $E$ to 
arise from VHS, and show that
\[
    \pushforward{p}(\Gr_FV_Y)^{G} = E
\]
