Variation of Hodge structure consists of the following data
\begin{enumerate}
\item A connected complex manifold $M$
\item A flat complex vector bundle $H_{\complex} \rightarrow M$ with 
    a flat real structure $H_{\real}$, and a flat bundle of lattice
    $H_{\integer} \subset H_{\real}$, {i.e.} transition functions
    of $H_{\complex}$ a locally constant and real-valued. The flat connection
    of $H_{\complex}$ has real valued connection matrix

\item An integer $k$
\item A flat, nondegenerate bilinear form $S$ on $H_{\complex}$ which is rational
    with respect to $H_{\integer}$, \emph{i.e} restricting to each fibre, $S$
    is a locally constant matrix of rational coefficient with repect to the chosen
    basis $H_{\integer}$
\item A decreasing filtration
\[
    H_{\complex} \supset F^1\supset \cdots \supset 0
\]
by holomorphic subbundle.
\end{enumerate}
The objects need to satisfy the following
\begin{enumerate}
\item Over each point $t$, $H_{\complex}, F, S$ restrict to a polarized Hodge 
    structure of weight $k$.
\item $\nabla(F^p) \subset F^{p-1}$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Classifying space for Hodge Structure}
Let $H_{\integer}$ be some lattice over $\integer$, and let $H_{\complex}$ 
be its complexification. Fix an integer $k$, and a collection of nonzero
integers $h^{p,q}$ such that $p + q = k$. First objective is to give a manifold
structure to the parameter space of all Hodge structure of weight $k$ on $H_{\complex}$.
Let $D_p = dim F^p = \sum\limits_{i\ge p} \HodgeNumber$. Then, we consider the product 
of Grassmannian
\[
    Grass = G(H_{\complex},D_0) \times G(H_{\complex}, D_1)\times\cdot \times 
\]
A possible filtration on $H_{\complex}$ can be considered as a point in $Grass$.
All possible filtrations on $H_{\complex}$ can be identified with the incidence
variety $I$ on $G$(why incidence variety is smooth)

The general linear subgroup of $H_{\complex}$ operates on $I$ transitively. 
The subset $F \subset I$ satisfying
\[
    H_{\complex} = F^p\oplus \bar{F}^{k-p+1}
\]
is an Zariski open subset of $I$. So $F$ parametrizes the Hodge structure on $H_{\complex}$.

Let $S$ be a nondegenerate bilinear form on $H_{\complex}$, symmetric or skew, depending
on the parity of $k$, such that 
\begin{align*}
    S(H^{p,q}, H^{r,s}) & = & 0, & \text{unless} p = s, q = r \\
    i^{p-q}S(v, \bar{v})& > & 0, & \text{if} v \in H^{p,q}, v\neq 0
\end{align*}

Let $\cech{D}$ be the points of $I$ satisfy condition 1.
\[
    G_{\complex} = \{g \in GL(H_{\complex}) | s(gu, gv) = S(u, v)\}
\]
operates on $\cech{D}$ transitively. 


Let $D \subset I$ be the subset of filtration satisfy the above two conditions.
$D$ is a open subvariety. 
\[
    G_{\real} = \{g\in GL(H_{\real}) | S(gu, gv) = S(u, v)\}
\]
acts transitively on $D$. Therefore, $D$ is smooth. $D$ parametrize Hodge 
structure of weight $k$ on $H_{\complex}$ with the polarization $S$

Choose a reference point $o \in D$, Let $H$ be the corresponding filtration.
Let $B \subset G_{\complex}$ that fixes $H$, \emph{i.e.} $gF^{p}(H) = F^{p}(H)$
for all $g\in B$ and all $p$. Then, we have a set-theoretical identification
\[
    G_{\complex}/B \cong \cech{D}
\]

One obtains analogous identification
\[
    G_{\real}/V \cong D, V = G_{\real}\cap B
\]
